# Sample Programs for Algorithm, Flowchart, and Pseudocode Development

## 1. Student Grade Calculator

**Program Description:**
Create a program that calculates the final grade for a student based on assignments (30%), midterm exam (30%), and final exam (40%). The program should determine if the student passed (â‰¥60%) or failed.

**Key Features:**
- Input assignment scores, midterm score, and final exam score
- Calculate weighted average based on predefined percentages
- Determine pass/fail status
- Display final grade and status to user
- ALGORITHM
- Algorithm
Start
Input assignment scores (list of scores)
Input midterm score
Input final exam score
Calculate the average of assignment scores
Calculate the weighted average:
Weighted average = (Average of assignments * 0.3) + (Midterm score * 0.3) + (Final exam score * 0.4)
Determine if the weighted average is greater than or equal to 60%
If yes, set status to "Pass"
If no, set status to "Fail"
Display the final grade and status

## 4. Prime Number Checker

**Program Description:**
Create a program that determines whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself with no other factors.

**Key Features:**
- Accept numerical input from user
- Verify if input is valid (positive integer)
- Use efficient algorithm to check for primality
- Display result with explanation
- Option to check additional numbers
- Algorithm to Determine if a Number is Prime:

 Get a number 'n' as input.
If 'n' is less than or equal to 1, return False (not prime).
Iterate from 'i' = 2 up to the square root of 'n'.
For each 'i', check if 'n' is divisible by 'i' (i.e., if 'n' % 'i' == 0).
 If 'n' is divisible by any 'i', return False (not prime).
 If the loop completes without finding any divisors, return True ('n' is prime).


 START

FUNCTION isPrime(number)
    IF number <= 1 THEN
        RETURN false
    IF number is 2 THEN
        RETURN true
    FOR i FROM 2 TO square root of number DO
        IF number MOD i == 0 THEN
            RETURN false
    RETURN true

LOOP
    DISPLAY "Enter a positive integer: "
    INPUT number

  IF number is not a positive integer THEN
        DISPLAY "Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer."
        CONTINUE

   IF isPrime(number) THEN
        DISPLAY number, "is a prime number."
    ELSE
        DISPLAY number, "is not a prime number."

  DISPLAY "Do you want to check another number? (yes/no)"

        EXIT LOOP

END


## 5. Temperature Conversion Tool

**Program Description:**
Develop a program that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user should be able to select the input and output temperature scales.

**Key Features:**
- Accept temperature value input
- Allow selection of source unit (C, F, or K)
- Allow selection of target unit (C, F, or K)
- Perform accurate conversion using correct formulas
- Display converted result with appropriate unit
- Option for multiple conversions

Algorithm for Temperature Conversion:
    Get the temperature value (number).
     Get the input temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
     Get the output temperature scale (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
    *Celsius to Fahrenheit:*
        * Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32
      *Celsius to Kelvin:*
        * Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
      *Fahrenheit to Celsius:*
        * Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
      *Fahrenheit to Kelvin:*
        * Kelvin = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15
      *Kelvin to Celsius:*
        * Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15
      *Kelvin to Fahrenheit:*
       Fahrenheit = (Kelvin - 273.15) * 9/5 + 32
    Use conditional statements (if/else or switch/case) to determine the correct conversion based on the input and output scales.
      If input and output scales are the same, the output is the same as the input.
      Display the converted temperature value along with the output temperature scale.


    
  START

FUNCTION convertTemperature(value, sourceUnit, targetUnit)
    IF sourceUnit == "C" AND targetUnit == "F" THEN
        RETURN (value * 9/5) + 32
    ELSE IF sourceUnit == "C" AND targetUnit == "K" THEN
        RETURN value + 273.15
    ELSE IF sourceUnit == "F" AND targetUnit == "C" THEN
        RETURN (value - 32) * 5/9
    ELSE IF sourceUnit == "F" AND targetUnit == "K" THEN
        RETURN (value - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15
    ELSE IF sourceUnit == "K" AND targetUnit == "C" THEN
        RETURN value - 273.15
    ELSE IF sourceUnit == "K" AND targetUnit == "F" THEN
        RETURN (value - 273.15) * 9/5 + 32
    ELSE
        RETURN value  // No conversion needed if units are the same

LOOP
    DISPLAY "Enter temperature value: "
    INPUT value

    DISPLAY "Enter source unit (C, F, K): "
    INPUT sourceUnit

    DISPLAY "Enter target unit (C, F, K): "
    INPUT targetUnit

    convertedValue = convertTemperature(value, sourceUnit, targetUnit)
    DISPLAY "Converted Temperature: ", convertedValue, targetUnit

    DISPLAY "Do you want to convert another temperature? (yes/no)"
    INPUT choice
    IF choice == "no" THEN
        EXIT LOOP
